Building this dashboard app that displays data in a meaningful and visual way can demonstrate your ability to work with data visualization libraries, created a custom UI components, and implement responsive design. I have added features such as charts, graphs, tables to make the data more interactive and useful to admin/users.

I have used antd and chartjs tools to show the data more smoothly.

Run this using `npm start`
